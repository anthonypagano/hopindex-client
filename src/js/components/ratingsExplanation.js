            <h2>Ratings Explanation</h2>
            <p>The range for ratings are whole numbers with 1 being the beer you never want to have again 5 being the best. A more detailed explanation for each level follows.</p>
            <p>1 - The worst. So bad you just had to spit out the first sip. You'd never order it again, and likely advise people against trying it as well.</p>
            <p>2 - Not for me. You had a couple sips but really didn't like it and wouldn't order it again.</p>
            <p>3 - Ok, pretty good. Tasted other things like it, if you saw it on a menu you'd consider ordering it.</p>
            <p>4 - Good stuff! You finished what you were served and asked for more. At this level you'd actively buy it if you saw it on a shelf or order it if you saw it on a menu.</p>
            <p>5 - Awesome! If you see it on a menu or know a retailer is carying it, stop what you are doing and acquire it now! Do not wait as others are probably already in line to buy!</p>
